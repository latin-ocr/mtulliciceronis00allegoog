, - et ferre et laturum esse: recalling iam urgentis and certe adventantis,
1. 16.

1 19 mihi: not really emphatic, but opposed to te and tu according
to the Roman fashion (cf. Cic. pro Rosc. 1).

120 eo . . . quo: ‘such . . . as!

1 21 uteretur: suij. of characteristic.

1 22 confectio: ‘composition.’

1 23 absterserit: Cicero admits to Atticus in one of his letters to
him (ad Att. 14, 21, 3) that old age is making him bitter, and that he
needs himself to take the medicine he has prescribed to others in his
essay: legendus mihi saepius est ‘Cato'Maior ’ ad te missus,· amariorem
enim me senectus facit. — mollem: 6 undisturbed.'

2 2 cui: this relative introduces the causal subjunctive possit. Its
case is governed by pareat.—pareat: suij. by attraction.—tempns
aetatis: ‘period of life? The word aetas as found in the Cato Maior
admits of at least three translations: 6 life ’ as a whole, as here; 6 period
of life: as in 4, p. 2, 1. 24; a special period of life, as ‘youth,’ in 45,
p. 19, 1. 153 ‘old age,’ in 39, p. 1§,1. 25.

2 3 possit: causal subj ν. Its subject is is (antecedent of qui) under-
stood. ,σαί qui pareat . . . possit is equivalent to cum is qui ei pareat . . .
possit.-A good parallel for the construction is fiound in Cic. Tusc. 5,
4 5 : qualia igitur ista bona sunt, quae qui habeat miserrimus esse possit ?

24 de ceteris . . . multa . . . hunc librum . . . de senectute: note 3
the elaborate chiasmus.—ceteris: other topics of philosophy (easily
inferred from the preceding sentence), not ‘other matters in general,'
in which case rebus would be regularly employed. Cicero uses a similar
method of transition in Tusc. 4, 5: sed de ceteras studiis alio loco et dice-
mus et saepe diximus. Here studiis is necessary to make the thought
clear.

25 misimus: epistolary perfect—autem: ‘ however.’ The thought
is: 6 Ι do not write it, however, as a treatise in my own person, but have
put it in the mouth of a fit speaker, not Tithonus, but,’ ete.

2 6 Tithono: an example of “ immortal age ’⁹ (see Index of Persons):

A white-hair'd shadow roaming like a dream
The ever-silent spaces of the East.— Tennyson, Tithonus.

2 7 Catoni seni: 6 Cat0‚ an old man‚' or 6 the aged Cat0‚’ not neces-
sarily 6 Cato the elder.' Cicero explains his reasons for making Cato the
spokesman, and uses the terms Cato Maior and Cato senex with clear
difference in meaning, Lael. 4: sed ut in ‘Catone Maiore,’ qui est scriptus
