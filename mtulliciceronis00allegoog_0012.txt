orations contain many indicationS. He had at various times
in his life come in contact with Greek representatives of all
the important schools of philosophy. In his early youth he
had studied with the Epicurean PhaedruS‚ and at first was

for their satisfaction and his own he studied and reproduced
in his philosophical works mainly the practical ethics of his
masters. He nowhere lays claim to originality, even along
these lineS. From the Greeks he adopts and adapts what suits
him, sets it forth in choice Latin enriched and made luminous
