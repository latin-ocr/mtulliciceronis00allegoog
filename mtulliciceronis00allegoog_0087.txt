NoTEs 65

theater at Rome was not built, however, till three years after Cato’s
death, and no permanent theater was built till B.c. 55.

20 25 propter: ‘near at hand'; the original adverbial use of the
preposition.

20 28 At: opposed to the concession that age feels less enjoyment. 49
—illa: ‘the following.'——emeritis stipendiis: i.e. discharged from service.
The required term of military service was sixteen years, after which the
man, having served his campaigns (earned his pay), was exempt.

2,0 30 secum esse: Cicero explains this expression in Tusc. 1, 75:
cum a negotio omni sevocamus animum, quid, inquam, tum agimus nisi
animum ad sc ipsum advocamus, secum esse cogimus?

20 31 ut dicitur: this show5, like quod aiunt (21, p. 9, 1. 18), that the
foregoing expression is a common one. — Si vero: ⁴ if again.'

21 1 otiosa: ‘ of retirement ' (from public business).

21 2 Videbamus: ‘we used to see.’ - dimetiendi paene: ‘ almost
measuring out the universe.'

21 4 illum . . . oppressit: ‘he was overtaken by‚’ eto—describere:
‘ draw.' ,

21 6 defectiones: according to tradition, eclipses had been predicted
as early as the sixth century, by Thales of MiletuS. There is an espe-
cial appropriateness in citing the achievements of Galus in this line,
as Scipio's father, Aemilius Paulus, was victor in the battle of Pydna,
previous to which Galus predicted the eclipse which occurred on its
eve, and thereby prevented the Roman soldiers from falling into the
same sort of panic which affected their enemieS.

21 7 levioribus: ‘more trivial.' To the Romans, literary pursuits were 50
of trifling importance compared to the practical affairs of life. Tacitus
(Ag. 4) says of the Roman general Agricola, in his youth, that if he
had not been restrained he would have studied philosophy ‘with more
interest and enthusiasm than befitted a Roman and a senator.’

21 9 Truculento: first performed about forty years before the dramatic
date of the Cato Maior (in ae. 189).—Pseud010: first performed B.c. 191.

21 10 sex annis: that the date is here emphasized, is probably due
to the fact that there were two traditions as to the time of Livius’
arrival at Rome, and Cicero wishes to emphasize the correct one (see
G. L. Hendrickson, A. s. P. XIX, 291). He had already discussed the
queStion at some length in the Brutus (72).

21 11 fabulam docuisset: ‘ brought out a play,’ the regular word, from
the author ‘teaching' the actore. — Centone Tuditanoque: B.c. 240. The
date is important as marking the beginning of Roman drama. Livius
