imus. Three guests‚ summus, medius, imus, reclined at each table. The
conversation began a summe, that is at the extreme left, and was
passed along from one to the other. The place of honor was the low-
est at the middle table—adhibetur in poculo: ‘is carried on as the
cup goes round.’

20 4 Symposio: ‘the Banquet.’ One of Xenophon’s works in which
Socrates is introduced.

20 5 rorantia: ⁴ drunk by sips.’ The whole expression minuta atque
rorantia is a translation of Xenophon’s own words: μικραῖς κύλιξι . . .
ἐπιψακάζωσιν.-ι·οἰι·ἰεει·εῒίο . . . ignis hibernus: as this whole passage
deals with the banquet, it is probable that these expressions refer to the
temperature of the dining-room. Wealthy Romans often had two dining-
roomS, one for summer and one for winter use. Cf. Juv. 7, 183: surgat
et algentem rapiat cenatio solem.

20 6 ignis hibernus: ‘the winter fire.’ -in Sabinis: ‘on my Sabine
estate!

20 7 compleo: ‘make up ' (the conventional number for a banquet).
The question of number was important at a Roman banquet, as the

in dies mitiora, 45, p. 19, l. 15.

20 13 adfecto aetate: ‘stricken in yearS.’—utereturne, ete.: ‘enjoyed
the pleasures of love!

20 14 Di meliora: supply duint, the old form of dent. The expression
is equivalent to ‘God forbid.'

20 18 non caret: Cicero (Tusc. 1, 88) defines carere in the words egere
eo quod habere velisx Inest enim velle in carenda.

20 19 hoc non desiderare: the infinitive is used substantively, with hoc
