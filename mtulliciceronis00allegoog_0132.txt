HIS well-known Latin grammar, although in a
T new form, still remains the Allen and Greenough
Grammar in scope and general plan, and retains

the characteristic qualities that have given the book a
world-wide distinction. But the book has been revised
in every detail to bring it into harmony with the latest
results of scholarship the world over, and has been

rearranged where necessary to make it as convenient ’

for use as is possible.

The authors have been assisted on details by the
most eminent specialistS, among whom are Professor ’
Sheldon of Harvard University and Professor Morris
of Yale University. The book therefore is thoroughly
trustworthy. All the most recent grammatical theories
have been considered, and if they have not been adopted
it is because the old ones are better. The paragraphs
have been renumbered throughout, and the typography
of the book has been completely changed. A new
scheme of type display unquestionably marks the

highest typographical achievement in books of this
character.
