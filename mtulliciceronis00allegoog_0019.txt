INTRODUCTION xv

‘ Catone Maiore ' satis multa diximus (a'e Off. 1, 151). Once
he refers to it as liber is . . . de senectute (de Div. 2, 3). It
seems evident, therefore, that the proper title is Cato Alaior.

With regard to the date of the Cato Maior two things can
be stated definitely. It was written before May 12, B.C. 44,
for Cicero alludes to it in a letter to Atticus written on that
day or the day before 3 it was written before the second book of
the de Divinatione, for it is mentioned in that book, and not
very long before, for it is spoken of as nuper interiectus. Book 2
of the de Divinatione, as is proved by internal evidence, was
written after the death of Julius Caesar (March 15, B.c. 44).
The Cato Maior, then, must have been written either shortly
after or shortly before this date.

The arguments used in the discussion of this question must
be based on passages in the second book of the de Divina-
tione, the letters of Cicero, and the Cato Maior itself. The
most convincing evidence to be found in these sources favors
the earlier date.

The important passage in the Cato Maior is in 1 : Et tamen
te suspicor eisdem rebus quibus me ipsum interdum gravius
commoveri, quarum consolatio et maior est et in aliud tempus
differenda. Every one recognizes here a distinct reference to
political troubles of some kind existing at the time when the
Cato Maior was being written. These may be either the con-
ditions under Antony after Caesar's death or the despotism
of Caesar in the months just preceding that event.

The fact that Cicero suggests writing a consolatio for these
troubles indicates the earlier date, as we know from his de
Divinatione (2, 6) that for this very state of things, a one-man·
power, he had before the death of Caesar found consolation
in the political theories of certain Greek philosopherS, while
in the period after Caesar's death he was at first in a frame
of mind rather suited to write a eulogy than a consolation,
later too dejected to recognize the possibility of a formal
