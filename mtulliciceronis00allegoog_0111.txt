CarneadeS, the founder of the New Academy, and CritolauS, a Peripa-
tetic. The Romans considered their influence pernicious (Carneades on
one day made an eloquent speech in favor of justice, and on the next
day with equal eloquence pleaded against it), and they were expelled
from Rome. Cato was one of their most violent opponente.

Duellius, C. (44), cos, B.C. 260, in which year he gained a naval vic·
tory over the CarthaginianS. Knowing the superiority of the enemy in
naval tacticS, he undertook to balance this by a kind of boarding-bridge,
which grappled the enemies’ ships and held them fast, after which the
battle became essentially a land fight, decided by the prowess of the
soldiers rather than by naval maneuverS. This victory over the enemy
on their own ground, in a branch of war-fare in which the Romans were
wholly inexperienced, naturally was of incalculable value in raising their
spirits and confidence, and gained great reputation for their commander.
A column, adorned with the beaks of ships, was erected in the Forum
in his honor, of which fragments are still extant.

Ennius, Q. (1, 10, 14, 16, 50, 73)‚,born at Rudiae B.c. 239, died 169.
Though not the earliest Roman writer, Ennius was recognized by the
Romans as the first really great genius in Roman literature and as the
father of. Roman poetry. His right to this title is based chiefly on his
Annales, an epic on Roman history, written in dactylic hexameter, a
meter not used before by any Roman writer. This work comprised
eighteen books, and covered Roman history from the landing of Aeneas
in Latium down to the Third Macedonian War. Ennius also wrote trage-
dies and comedies (largely adapted from the Greek), and various miscel-
laneous poemS, also showing strongly the influence of Greek thought.
He was, like Scipio, the very opposite of Cato in his attitude toward
Greek and the Greeks, yet according to tradition it was Cato who first
brought him to Rome, B.C. 204, after meeting him in Sardinia, where he
was serving in the Roman army.

Epicurus (43), a Greek philosopher, founder of the school of phi-
losophy which bears his name, lived B.C. 341—270. The physics of the
Epicureans were based on the atomic theory of DemocrituS. They held
that the universe was made up of void and of atoms —invisible bodies
differ-ing in size and shapes and indestructible. It had come into being
by the chance combination of these atomS, and would finally cease to
exist in its present form, the atoms re·combining into new forms. The
human soul‚ made up of very fine, smooth atomS, would itself be dis-
solved at the dissolution of the body. The ethics of the Epicureans made
pleasure the highest good (summum bonum). These two ideas—the
