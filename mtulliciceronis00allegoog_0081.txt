NoTEs 59

15 30 Ita . . . si: ‘ only on condition . . . that.’--so ipsa defendit: ‘is 38
its own defense)

15 31 nemini mancipata: ⁴ in no man's power,’ lit. ‘sold' (like a slave)
‘to no one ’ (manus ÷ capio). Emanctpare is the usual word for this in
Cicer0. See App. Manczpatio was the formal process of transferring
property, a part of which was the laying of the hand upon the object
boughn

· 16 5 Septimus mihi liber Originum: see Intr„ p. xiv.—est in manibus:
‘ I am at work upon! For the same meaning, cf. 22, p. 10, L 3.

16 6 monumenta: ‘recordsss
- 16 7 nunc cum maxime conficio: ‘just at this very time I am putting ,
together.' The speeches were carefully worked over by the orators for
publication, as Cicero's were,—often so as to be quite different from
the real oneS‚ as in the case of the speech for Mi10.

16 8 ius . . . civile: the'secular law as distinguished from the rules
governing religious ceremonials used by the augurs and the pontiffs.

16 9 Graecis litteris: see note on 26, p. 11, l. 18. This fact is empha-
sized as in contrast to his work on the Origines, which was the first
Roman history written in Latin prose. All preceding Roman prose
writers had used Greek. — Pythagoreorumque modo: sels-examination
was part of the discipline of the PythagoreanS. But Cicero is alone
in assigning the training of the memory as their reason for it.

16 10 exercendae memoriae: the necessity of this has already been
emphasized in 21.

16 11 exercitationes ingeni: perhaps recalling the complaint of Milo
(27), himself a Pythagoream that he could no longer engage in the
exercitationes of athletics‚ for which those of the ingenium may be
considered a substitute.

16 14 Adsum: i.e. attend in the courts—a regular duty of Roman
citizens—ultroque adfero: i.e. not merely attend to the necessary
business of the hour. Though no senator, strictly, could introduce a
measure of his own motion, yet when called upon to vote he could
speak on any point, whether ‘⁴ in order'’ or not, as did Cato (delenda
est Karthago).

16 17 lectulus: a reading-conch, corresponding in function to the
modern easy-chair.

16 18 aeta vita: ‘my past life!

16 19 viventi: depending grammatically on obrepat, but belonging
also to intellegy‘tur. ·

16 23 quod . . . dicunt: in appositidn with tertia vituperatio. 39
