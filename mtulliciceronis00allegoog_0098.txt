76 ON OLD AGE

31 12 voluntariam mortem: sacrificing themselves for their armies·
See Index of PersonS‚ Decius.

81 13 M. Atilium: Regulus,

31 15 Poenis: the forces left in Spain by Hannibal under the com-
mand os his brother Hasdrubal.

31 17 collegae: the colleagues in the consulship for the year B.c. 216
were Gaius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paulus (father of the
victor of Pydna). Paulus was inclined, on the present occasion, to follow
a cautious policy‚ and it was Varro who was responsible for the dis·
astrous battle of Cannae. By the irony of fate Varro escaped alive,
while Paulus perished.—Cannensi ignominia: the word ignominia is
well chosen‚ for the defeat at Cannae (see Index of PersonS, Hannibal)
was the most crushing that the Romans met with at the hands of Han-
nibal. Besides the consul PauluS, two quaestorS, twenty-one military
tribuneS, and eighty senators were slain, and tradition runs that “ Han-
nibal sent to Carthage a peck of gold rings, the distinctive badge of
the Roman knight.’'

31 18 temeritatem: the cautious policy of Fabius Maximus Cunctator,
who had been dictator the previous year,·had become unpopular at
Rome with many, but the results of the opposite policy at Cannae justi-
fied the application of such words as temeritas to the aggressive activity
desired by these critics. — Μ. Marcellum: killed in an ambuscade 13.C. 208.
See Index of PersonS. ,

31 19 crudelissimus: perfidy and cruelty were the stock character· v
istics ascribed to Hannibal by the Romans. Cicer0, Lael. 28, contrasts
Hannibal with Pyrrhus in this respect: ab altero (Pyrrhus), propter
probitatem eius, non nimis alienos animos habemus, alterum (Hannibal),
propter crudelitatem, semper haec ct'vims oderit.

31 21 in Originibus: this statement Cicero elsewhere (Tusc. 1, 101)
quotes directly from Cato: sed quid duces . . . nominem, cum legiones
scribat Cato saepe alacris in eum locum profectas unde redituras se non
arbitrarentur? —alacri . . . erecto: ‘with high and eager courage.’

31 24 indocti: i.e. in philosophy.

76 31 25 Omnino: ‘ on the whole‚’ ‘to sum all up.’

31 29 constans . . . media: ‘well—settled period of middle life, so
called!

32 1 occidunt: ‘fall away!

77 326 quo . . . propius absum: ‘the nearer I am to it.’ Note the
difference between the Latin and the English idiom.

82 7 Laeli: the father of Laelius was a very intimate friend of Cato.
