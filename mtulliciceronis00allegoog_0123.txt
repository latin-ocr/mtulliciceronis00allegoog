Descripta03 discriptae: both supported by good MSS. Descri-
bere means most commonly ⁴ transcribe ’ or ⁴ describe.’ Here it must
mean ‘write out’ (Reid). Cf. Vergil, A. 3, 445: quaecumque in
fhliis descripsit carmina virga, and Cic. pro Sest. 91 : ut quodam
tempore homines neque naturali neque civili iure descripte, fusi
per agros ac dispersi vagarentur.

Discribere would mean ‘assign’ is partes means ‘r61e5,’ ‘dispose’
or ‘arrange' if it means ‘portioris’ or ‘acts' of the play. But the
figure here seems to be used not to compare the degrees of skill
shown either in the assignment of the several τδΙεε, or in the ar-
rangement of the different portions of the play in relation to each
other, but to that shown in working up each separate act. The
*earlier acts are satisfactory (youth etc.)‚ and Nature is too good an
artist to write the last act (old age) with less skill than these. An
original describere might have been corrupted to discribere through
the influence of a misinterpretation of partes as ‘roles’

1 The editor wishes here to acknowledge special indebtedness to the
Critical Appendix in F. G. Moore's edition.
