The real subiect of the essay begins here. The connection with the
preceding part is as follows: Ennius bore cheerfully two things which
are commonly considered great burdens—poverty and old age. And
old age may be considered a burden with some show of reason, for Ι
find four serious indictments commonly brought against it. The con·

his Growing Old:

statesmen of the time of Pyrrhus, all plebeians‚ and men equally dis-

admire. Indeed Juvenal, Sat. 11, 90, in giving a similar catalogue of
worthy antiqui, puts Cato himself in the same list with them:

cum tremerent autem Fabios durumque Catonem
et Scauros et Fabricios,

and Cicero, de Or. 3, 56, speaks of Fabricii, Coruncanii, Catones.
