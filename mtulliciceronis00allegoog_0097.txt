NOTES 75

as he can perform his duties and feel no concern in reg-ard to death.
Of these two points munus . . . tueri covers the ground of the first
three common charges against old age mentioned in 15, while mo'rtem
contemnere covers the last, quod haud procul absit a morte.

80 15 Hoc illud est, quod . . . responsum est: ‘ this is the meaning of
that famous answer which,’ etc. “

80 18 Sed vivendi, etc.: but scom of death should not lead men to
anticipate nature by bringing their lives to an end themselves,

80 20 coagmentavit: ‘put together)

80 24 Ita fit: it is not easy to find a clear and logical argument in
71, 72, and 73, but in this sentence are summed up the two main points:
(1) ‘death should not be feared’3 (2) ‘death should not be sought.’

80 25 nec sine causa: the Stoics considered that suicide was justified
if the reason for it was sufficiently strong. Cato Uticensis, the great-
grandson of Cato the Censor, committed suicide after the battle of
ThapsuS‚ B.c. 46, and Cicero wrote a eulogy of him.

80 26 vetatque Pythagoras: the same idea is expressed by Cicero in
T usc. 1, 74: vetat ’enim dominus ille in nobis deus iniussu hinc nos suo
demigrare, and de Rep. 6, 15. Cf. also Plato, PhaedO, 61.

80 28 elogium: for a Latin translation of this couplet see Cic. Tusc. 73
1, 117 (where it is contrasted with the sentiment of Ennius):

Mors mea ne careat lacrimis: linquamus amicis
maerorem, ut celebrent funera cum gemitu.

80 29 Volt . . . se esse: ‘wishes to make out that he is ’ (Reid). In this

general sense volo regularly takes an inf. with subj. acc.; G. 546, 2, R. 1.

80 31 Nemo, etc.: Cicero quotes the couplet complete in Tusc. 1, 34.
The rest of the second verse, omitted here, runs:
cur? volito vivus per ora virum.

80 32 Faxit: old form of perf. suij. The use of the lierf. suij. in
a wish is archaic; §441, a; G. 260; H. 558, 1, N.

81 2 sensus moriendi: ‘ sensation in dying.’ 74 -

81 3 isque: que is adversative as in 13, p. 6, 1. 21, vixitque—ad
exiguum tempus: ‘only for a moment!

81 5 hoe: anticipatory, i.e. ut mortem neglegamus. —- meditatum:
‘dwelt upon.’

81 7 incertum an: ‘we know not but.'

81 9 animo consistere: ‘ have any firmness of mind!

81 11 in liberanda patria: Brutus was killed by Aruns Tarquinius,
son of Tarquinius Superbus, on the occasion of the first attempt of 75
