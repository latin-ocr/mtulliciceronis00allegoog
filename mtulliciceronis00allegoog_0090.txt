68 ΟΝ OLD AGE

22 24 silvescat sarmentis: ‘become a forest of shoots.’ The growth
of “new wood'’ (sarmenta) in one season from a single bud has some-
times amounted to more than a hundred feet, including ramificationS.

22 25 ninia: if the vine is allowed to grow too luxuriantly, the
strength goes into leaves instead of fruit.

53 22 26 exsistit: ‘starts forth.’—articulos: this word in Cicero’s time
seems to have been used literally only of the joints of animaIs, hence
tamquam to indicate that it is here used figuratively.

22 27 gemma dicitur: in reality ‘bud,’ an outgrowth‚ is the literal
meaning of the word, and ‘gem' the figurative. Bu‘t Cicero (de Or.
3, 155), and Quintilian after him, believed the opposite to be true,
and used gemma and gemmare, of buds, as examples of figurative use
where no literal equivalent existed. Cf. Quint. 8, 6, 6: necessitate rustici
gemmam in vitibus (dicunt), quid enim dicerent aliud?

22 31 laetius: used in an active sense, ‘ more gladdening.'

23 2 ante: see 51, p. 22,1. 1.

283 capitum iugatio: connecting of the tops of the ‘stakes' or
‘props’ (adminiculi) for the vines to run on. —religatioz ‘tying up.’

28 4 propagatio: ‘training' or ‘guiding forward’ of the young
shoots·

235 inmissio: ‘sparing' to grow3 or perhapS, ‘training‘ of other
shoots in the spaees left.

23 6 repastinationes: ‘trenching'

54 28 8 de rebus rusticis: the bopk is cited both as de Re Rustica and
de Agri Cultura. It is tolerably well preserved.

239 doctus: like the Greek σοφός, ‘skilled‚' often used of poets.
The reference is to Hesiod's Works and Days. —ne verbum quidem:
probably because the rich plains of Boeotia needed no manuring.

28 11 multis . . . ante saeculis: these words are more than a mere
digression, for they touch upon one of the unsettled literary questions
of Cicero's time and earlier— the chronological relation of Homer to
Hesiod. Accius, one of the most important critics before Cicero’s time,
put Hesiod first: M. autem Varro, in primo de Imaginibus, uter prior sit
natus parum constare dicit . . . Accius autem, in primo Didascalico, levi·
bus admodum argumentis· utitur per quae ostendi putat Hesiodum natu
priorem (Aul. Gell. 3, 11, 3). — Laertam: Laertes, father of Ulysses
(Od. 24, 225). The desiderium is for the long absence of his son at the
siege of Troy, and during his Subsequent wanderingS. Homer does not
represent him as stercorantem, but as digging (λιστρεύοντα), which in
Cicero’s mind might include the other.
