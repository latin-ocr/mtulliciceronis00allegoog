suasissem3 suasi sed: suasissem is found in most MSS. Suasi
sed (F orchhammer) is a conjecture based on suasisset of one (or
possibly two) MSS. It must be admitted that this would seem
here the more natural construction. Suasissem, however, can be
grammatically defended, as has been done by Hale, Cum Construc-
tions, p. 1893 and in view of its better support in the manuscripts
it has been retained.

Facit . . . facit3 faciat . . . faciat: if facit is read in the first
place, it must be also in the second. It is therefore only the first
that need be discussed here. The MS. authority forsaciat in both
places is better than fo? facit. But if faciat is read, (1) the guber-
nator is contrasted with the iuvenes, whereas there is no reason to
assume that the gubernator was a senex3 (2) the expression is
weak and superfluous after the full description of the respective
duties which precedes3 (3) if the subject of the verb is senex or
senectus (which it cannot be if faciat be read), the connection be·
tween this clause and the next, non viribus . . . solet, is much clearer
and stronger. For the second then takes up and enlarges upon the
thought of the first clause: old men do more important work than
young men, for mental and moral powers are needed for these
¹things more than physical strength and vigor, and the former are
qualities of the old, the latter of the young. ’
