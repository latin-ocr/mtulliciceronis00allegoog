INTRODUCTION xi

In form it is a dialogue, not that of the Socratic or Platonic
type, where questions and answers alternate rapidly and in
their interchange develop the thought of the writer, but rather
oi the Aristotelian type, wherein the dialogue soon becomes
practically a monologue in the mouth of the chief speaker.
The dialogue is put, apparently, in the last year of Cato’s long
life, and represents the old man ¹ discoursing, calmly and cheer-
fully, with the younger Scipio (Aemilianus), brother—in-law of
Cato’s elder son, and his friend LaeliuS, the same who gives
his name to the dialogue on friendship. Cicero himself was
strongly attracted by some points of the old statesman’s life
and character, -his plebeian birth, his political struggles, his in-
tellectual eminence, and his genuine love of rural occupationS.
The incidents of his career he has studied carefully and intro-
duced into his discourse, with here and there a bit of his antique
style, — antiquior sermo, horn'diora verba? But though the
discourse is put in Cato's mouth, it is Cicero that speakS.
Not merely is there the ripe Latin of the last century of the
RepubliC, and the perfection of style of the greatest of Roman
authorS, but even the thoughts and sentiments are not such
as belong to the tough and hard-headed Cat0, whom Cicero
employs as a lay-figure, to be dressed in the mental costume
of his own day.

And, withal, he fashions the antique character into some-
thing οἱ his own more modern likeneSS. The Cato of the dia·
logue is mild-mannered, reflective, at home in philosophical
literature, and even not disinclined to music, after the example
of Socrates· The real Cato was harsh in temper, narrow in
prejudice, a shrewd hater of the elder Scipi0, who was his rival,

¹ Lael. 4: Catonem induxi senem disputantem, quia nulla videbatur
aptior persona quae de illa aetate loqueretur, quam eius qui et diutissime
senex suisset, et in ipsa senectute praeter ceteros floruisset. . . . Itaque :pse
mea legens sic adficior interdum, ut Catonem, non me, loqui existimem.
