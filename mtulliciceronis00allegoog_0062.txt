40 oN OLD AGE

ad te de senectute, Catonem induxi senem disputantem, quia nulla vide-
batur aptior persona quae de illa aetate loqueretur quam eius qui et diu-
tissime senex suisset et in ipsa senectute praeter cete'ros floruisset, etc.

2 8 Apud quem: ‘ at whose house!

2 9 Laelium et Scipionem: these two names are types of friendship
like Damon and Pythias, or David and jonathan. Cicero’s treatise on
Friendship‚ de Amicitia, the companion to the de Senectute, has its name
from Laelius, as the latter from Cato, and in one of his letters (ad Fam.
5, 7, 3) he Jestingly expresses the hope that the same relations may exist
between himself and Pompey as those between Laelius and Scipio: ut
tibi multo maiori quam Africanus suit, . . . me, non multo minorem quam
Laelium, facile et in re publica et in amicitia adiunctum esse patiare.

2 11 ipse: 'as opposed to the part he plays in this book.

2 12 attribuito: ‘you must ascribe it.' For the use of the future im· '
perative‚ especially common in apodoses and in familiar language, see
§4493 Β. 281, 1, a; G. 268, 2.—litteris Graecis . . . in senectute: this

man is probably untrue‚ as is indicated by various ‚incidents recorded of
his life.

2 14 plura: se. dicere. — Iam: ‘ presently.’

4 2 16 Saepe numero: ⁴ oftentimes,’ lit. ⁸ often by count!

2 17 excellentem: as compared with others,

2 18 perfectam: ‘absolut‘e.'—quod . . . senserim: informa] indindisc.
following admirari.

2 20 Aetna: a proverbial expression from Euripides (Herc. Fur. 637),
referring to the myth of Enceladus buried beneath Mt. Etna. Cf. Long-
fellow’s Enceladus .·

Under Mount Etna he lies,
It is slumber‚ it is not death, etc.

’2 22 -haud sane: ⁴ not very.’ A kind of litoteS‚ always with a jocose
ἢ turn, as our ‘⁴ not much of‚” etc. *-

2 24 omnis aetas: equivalent to omne tempus aetatis in 2, p. 2, l. 2.

2 25 omniabona . . . adferat: these Stoic sentiments are put naturally
in the mouth of Cat0‚ to whose character the doctrine had a special fit-
ness. Yet his native austerity did not make Cato a disciple of the Stoic
system of philosophy, like Scipio and LaeliuS, and in urging the expul-
