19 13 Magnae Matris: i.e. Cybele, a goddess of nature, worshiped

Romans found in the Sibylline BookS, during the war with Hannibal,
a prophecy that a foreign enemy would be expelled from Italy when
the Idaean mother should come from Pessinus to Rome. An embassy
was accordingly sent to King Attalus of PergamuS, who actually gave
into their possession the meteoric stone which was the fetish of this
worship. The oracle prescribed that it should be received by the man
qui vir optimus Romae esset, and the Senate fixed upon the young
Publius Scipio Nasica, son of Gnaeus (see 29, p. 12, 1. 20). From this

with processione, beating of drumS‚ and dramatic exhibitions. It was at
this festival, in the years between 166 and 161 13.c., that four of Terence’s
plays were first produced, the Andria, Hecyra, Heauton Timarumenos,
and Eunuchus. ο
