5 11 cum quidem: ‘at which very time.’ Cato has now traced his
acquaintance with Fabius to the time when he was really admodum
grandis· natu. The whole of this prelude, suited to the garrulousness
of age, indicates also the respective dates of these lives—legis Cinciae:
(B.C. 204) ordaining ne quis ob causam orandam pecuniam'donumve acci-
peret. This was on'e of a series of laws designed to shut out the gov-

of letters, of Greek birth too, like Ennius. Indeed, he reproached M.
Fulvius Nobilior, a leader in the Hellenizing movement of the clay,
for having taken Ennius with him on his campaign in Aetolia. In sup-
port of Cicero's representation here, however, it should be noticed that
Cato was responsible for Ennius' first going to Rome (see Index of Per-
sons— Ennius), and that Cato’s deeds were glorified by Ennius in his
Annales.

5 16 Unus, etc.: quoted from the Annales of Ennius, The same lines
are again quoted by Cicer0‚ de Off. 1, 84, ancl (the first verse) ad Att. 2,
19, 2. Vergil adapts the first line, A. 6, 845:
