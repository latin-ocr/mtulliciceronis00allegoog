Laelius, C. (77), cos, B.C. 190, father of the interlocutor in the Cato
Maior, a friend of the elder Scipi0, as his son was of the younger.

Laelius Sapiens, C., b. Rc, 190, cos. 140, interlocutor in the Cato Mitior.

maximuS, cos. B.C. 205. He took part in the war against Hannibal.

Livius Andronicus (50), the earliest figure (excepting Appius Claudius)
in the history of Roman literature. He was a Greek by birth (of Taren-
tum), was brought to Rome prisoner, and there, B.C. 240, exhibited a.
comedy and a tragedy, the first Latin playS, adapted from the Greek.
He also translated the Odyssey into Latin Saturnian verse. His work is
important rather for the impulse it gave than for its own meritS. He
lived ca. B.<:. 284—204.

Livius Salinator, C. (7), cos, Rc, 188. His most important achieve-
ment was his naval victory when in command of the fleet against

campaign against Hasdrubal B.C. 207, erroneously represented by Cicero
as in command at Tarentum. It was in reality Marcus Livius Macatus

recovery. For explanation of Cicero’s error, see A. J. P. XIX, 437
(1898). .

Lysander (59, 63), a distinguished Spartan general, who defeated the
Athenians at Aegospotami, 13.c.'4o4. He used against Athens the aid

died 184. He translated from the Greek (very freely) the comedies of

both of those mentioned in the Cato Maior), and form the earliest com-
plete specimens of Roman literature now existing. In spite of their
Greek origin they have a strongly Roman ssavor.
