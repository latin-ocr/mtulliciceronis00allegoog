NOTES 61

17 18 si quidem: ‘since,' a common meaning; ξ 39ς G. 595, R. 53
H. 316, 7. .

17 19 longior: except with words denoting time, longus (protracted)
is rare in the Ciceronian period, and apparently not used by Cicero
elsewhere.

17 20 Haec: ‘ thus my host Nearchus used to say (that) he had heard
that Archytas discoursed with Pontius.’

17 24 cum quidem . . . interfuisset: the cum clause is purely circum-
stantial; see note on 16, p. 8, l. 2, cum interfuissent.

17 26 L. camillo: this was 13.C. 349, the year before Plato’s death.
Plato's latest authentic visit to Sicily (his third) was 13.c. 361. It is
probable therefore that Cicero is wrong here. ’

17 27 intellegeretis, etc.: imperfect, as following an implied past tense. 42

18 2 Invitus feci ut . . . eicerem: ‘it was with reluctance that I ex-
pelled'; 556& B. 284, r; G. 553, 1; H. 571, 3.—T. Flaminini: see note
on 1, p. 1, l. 1, and Index of Persons. T. F lamininus’ brother Lucius was
consul B.C. 192. During his consulship he carried on war successfully in
Cisalpine Gaul, at which time occurred the incident here related.

18 3 s'eptem annis: this was the full number of years intervening
between the consulship of L. Flamininus (B.c. 192) and the censorship
of Cato and L. FlaccuS, B.c. 184. The censorship of T. Flamininus and
M. Marcellus was B.c. 189. The story is an illustration of the preceding
sentence, but the old man’s loquacity destroys the logical connection.

18 4 fuisset: subj. as following cicerem. See note on 33, p. 14, l. 7,
dum adsit—notandam: the technical word for the formal mark of dis·
approbation, nota censoria, officially passed upon a man by the censor.

18 5 exoratus . . . est: ‘was prevailed upon’; see Liv. 39, 433 Plut.
Flamininus, 18.

18 11 imperi: the supreme official power conferred upon him by the
comitia curiata (see note on 64, p. 27, l. 17). To disgrace the imperium
was to disgrace the state.

18 15 quendam: Epicurus (see Index of Persons), whom Cicero never 43
loses an opportunity of attacking, and to whom the Stoics were espe-
cially opposed. Cicero (de Fin. 2, 7) refers to Epicurus’ claim to the title
of sapiens as a mark of arrogance: quise unus, quod sciam, sapientem
profiteri sit ausus.

18 18 ut id . . . persuaderetur: ‘that the Samnites . . . might be per-
suaded of this! ’

18 19 Samnitibus: the Samnites were a vigorous and powerful na-
tion of central Italy, the last and most persistent defenders of Italian
