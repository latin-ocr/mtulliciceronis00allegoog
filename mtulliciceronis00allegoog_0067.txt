on account of his conservative policy. —ponebat2 for the ἆ see note on
versat, 1, p. 1, 1. 2.—salutem·„ i.e. of the state.

5 18 post: i.e. not only then, but as it is now. —magisz ‘more’ (than
it otherwise would).

5 19 Tarentum: Tarentum fell into the hands of Hannibal Β. (3. 213. 11
It was retaken by the Romans, under Fabius Maximus, Β. C. 209. ⁴

5 20 Salinatori. a mistake of Cicero’.s M. Livius Salinator was a
distinguished and successful general in the campaign against Hasdrubal,
B.c. 2073 it was M. Livius Macatus that lost Tarentum, and gave effi-
cient service from the citadel in its recovery. See Index of Persons.

5 24 in toga: i.e. in civil affairs. Pacis est insigne et oti toga ,· contra
autem arma, tumultus atque belli. Cic. in Pis. 7 3.— consul iterum: ‘being
consul for a second term ’ (Β.(3. 228). The law of Flaminius was passed
in 232, so that Cicero is mistaken in putting the consulship of Fabius
and Camillus in the same year with it.

’ 5 25 C. Flaminio: the chief popular leader of his day, often held up
to reproach by writers, like Cicero, of aristocratic sympathies. The
reproach was enhanced by his disgraceful blunder in the battle of Lake
Trasimenus, B.C. 217, in which his army was cut to pieces and he him-
self killed. In spite of his ill repute as a demagogue, and his military
failure‚ Flaminius was the author of some very salutary measures. In
his tribunate, B.C. 232, he carried the law here referred tc, dividing the
Gallie and Picene territory among poor citizens, — the policy afterwards
revived by the Gracchi, and perhaps the most hopeful remedy of the
evils of the State. This measure he c'arried by a popular vote, against ’
the opposition of the Senate, an act which was strictly unconstitutional,
inasmuch as -this was an administrative measure, which fell·within the
province of the Senate.

5 27 dividenti: this participle has a conative force.

5 28 dicere ausus est: the expression here quoted was safe enough
in the mouth of a leader of the aristocracy, as Fabius was—at once
senator, executive officer, and interpreter of the omenS. But it of course
struck at the root of the whole Roman polity and religion, betraying a
. decline of faith which was the first symptom of national decay.-optimis
auspiciis, etc.: cf. Iliad 12, 243 (Lang, Leaf‚ and Myers): ‘⁴ But thou bid-
dest us be obedient to birds long of wing, whereto I give no heed, nor
take any care thereos, whether they fare to the right, to the dawn and to .
the sun, or to the left, to mist and darkness. . . . One omen is best, to
fight for our own country.”

5 30 ferrentur: legem serre = ‘to propose a law!
