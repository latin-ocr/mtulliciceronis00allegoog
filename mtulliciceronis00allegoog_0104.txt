Acilius Balbus, Μ’. (14), consul with T. Quinctius FlamininuS, B.c. 1 50,
the assumed date of the Cato Maior.

Acilius Glabrio, Μ’. (32), probably ancestor of a family of some dis-
tinction in Cicero’s time. As consul, 13.C. 191, he defeated Antiochus
the Great at Thermopylae. Cato served under him in this campaign as
consularis· legatus (Liv. 36, 17), or, more probably, as tribunus militum
(Plut. Cat. 12), and played an important part in winning the victory, lead-
ing his men by a mountain pass to attack the rear of Antiochus' forceS.

Aelius Paetus Catus, Sex. (27), named Catus from his acuteneSS‚ the
most distinguished jurist of his time, iuris abilis· omnium pert'teksimus
(Cic. Brut. 78), cos. B.C. 198. The Aelian gens was distinguished for the
number of jurists it produced.

Aemilius Lepidus, M. (61), cos. 13.c. 187 and 17 5; pontifex maximus,
and six times appointed princeps senatus, the highest dignity in the
state. At his death, in 152, he charged his sons to bury him with no
display and at moderate expense: imaginum specle, non sumptibus, γ
nobilitari magnorum virorum ficnera solere (Liv. E pit. 48).

Aemilius Paulus, L. (29, 61, 75, 82), cos. 13.c. 219 and 216, killed in his
second consulship in the battle of Cannae. He was father of the victor
of Pydna (see below), and grandfather of the younger AfricanuS. His
daughter married the elder Africanus·

Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus, L. (15, 82), cos, 13.C. 182 and 168, son of
the foregoing. In his second consulship Macedonia and the war against
Perseus (Third Macedonian War) fell to his lot. He ended the war by
his victory at Pydna, B.C. 168. He had four sons, the two y'ounger of
whom died early, one just before and one just after his Macedonian
triumph, while the two older were adopted, one into the Fabian, one
into the Cornelian gens. The latter thus became Publius Cornelius
Scipio Aemilianus Africanus Minor. He also had two daughters, one
of whom married the son of Cat0. (See genealogical table of the Scipios.)
